    "hexadecimal is BASE 16 which, if you remember for above, means two things. Firstly, every colum is 16^x i.e:\n",

    "# HEX AND COLOUR AND IMAGES\n",
    "\n",
    "Where this becomes useful or practical is in images and understanding all that shiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically images are made up of 3 layers of values to make each pixel. The values are between 0 and 255, and the 3 layers correspond to three colurs, red, green and blue. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if a picture is 64 x 64 pixels, it is made up of 3 * 64 x 64 squares of values. One for each of the colours, and for each of the colours the 64 * 64 square is made up of numbers between 0 and 255. \n",
    "\n",
    "The zero and 255 comes from the fact that for each pixel it is combo of 3 different intensities of those three coours. And the spectrum of each colour has been divided into 255 because at the binary computer level those colours are described/represented by BYTES and each bye is 8 bits and each bit is a binary number 1 or 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So each colour red, green or blue can only be represented on a scale of binary 00000000 to binary 11111111\n",
    "\n",
    "And 11111111 IS 255 in decimal. Which means there are only 255 possibilities, so the scale must be 0 to 255. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, those binary number are long and a bit much for some people, so some clever wag realised that 0 to 255 in decimal (00000000 to 11111111 in binary) can ALSO be represent in 00 to FF in hexadecimal! i.e. in only 2 characters!!!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Where 00 is still zero, \n",
    "but FF is F * 16^1 + F * 16^0\n",
    "F = 15 in hexadecimal\n",
    "so FF = 15 * 16^1 + 15 * 16^0\n",
    "= 15 * 16 + 15 * 1\n",
    "= 240 + 15\n",
    "= 255\n",
    "\n",
    "EDIT - sometimes hex codes are preceded by a Ox or maybe 0x to indicate it is hex so 1A might be Ox1A. Likewise a hex for a colour might be \n",
    "Ox11FF12 which means 11 FF 12 where 11 is r FF is G and 12 is B\n",
    "\n",
    "# SIDE NOTE - OCTAL - BASE 8\n",
    "\n",
    "You also see octal which is base 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "So from our previous exploration we know that the octal system will represent numerical values by columns which represent values of 8 ^ x, and where is column can only have one of 8 values 0 to 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have 8^x, 8^1000000 . . . 8^5, 8^3, 8^2, 8^1, 8^0 // 8^-1, 8^-2\n",
    "\n",
    "so the number 341 in OCTAL is\n",
