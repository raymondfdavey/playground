"echo $PATH"

Displays path

"sudo nano /etc/paths"

Enter password and then it will display list of paths you can add too

"nano .zshrc" while in home dir opens the .zshrc file from which you can add to path by adding in the below line which declares the new location /Users/yourusername/bin as well as prefixing the original path declared as $PATH.

export PATH=$PATH:/Users/yourusername/bin

(explained in more detail below)


///

Adding in a Permanent Location

To make the new path stick permanently you need to add or edit a .zshrc file in your home directory and add to the path there.

This configuration file controls various Terminal environment preferences including the path.

In macOS Big Sur and Catalina the default shell is Zsh aka the Z Shell (previously it was the Bash Shell).

cd

This command moves you into home directory, if you are already in the home directory then you are in the right spot. Check you have a .zshrc file by running the ls -la command which shows the directory files.

If you don’t have it, create it and edit it with a command line editor called nano:

touch .zshrc
nano .zshrc
If you do have it just edit it:

nano .zshrc
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/yourusername/bin

Add in the above line which declares the new location /Users/yourusername/bin as well as prefixing the original path declared as $PATH.

Macos Bigsur Add Path Zsh Shell

 

 

Also if you have an existing .zshrc file it may have these lines in it:

# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
Just uncomment the second line

# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
 export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
Add in any extra paths colon separating them with no trailing slash

 

Saving the Edits in Nano
Save the file in nano by clicking ‘control’ +’o’ and confirming the name of the file is .zsh by hitting return. And the ‘control’+’x’ to exit nano.

Either refresh the .zshrc file by using source or restart the Terminal:

source .zshrc
So now when the Terminal is relaunched or a new window made and you check the the path by

echo $PATH
You will get the new path at the front followed by the default path locations, all the time

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin/Users/yourusername/bin
Rearranging the default $PATH
If you needed to rearrange the paths in the default $PATH variable, you can just do that and leave off $PATH.

So lets say you want /usr/local/bin at the beginning to take precedence you can add the default path like so inside .zsh
